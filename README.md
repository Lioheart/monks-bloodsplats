# Monk's Bloodsplats
Add-On Module for Foundry VTT
It's just a bunch of little things to make the program run a little smoother and look a little better.  But a lot are based on personal preference.

## Installation
Simply use the install module screen within the FoundryVTT setup

## Usage & Current Features
When an Monster is killed, show it as a blood splat rather than the icon.  I find this eliminates a bit of clutter on the screen and makes it easier to see what's going on.  Player characters still show with the skull.

## Bug Reporting
I'm sure there are lots of issues with it.  It's very much a work in progress.
